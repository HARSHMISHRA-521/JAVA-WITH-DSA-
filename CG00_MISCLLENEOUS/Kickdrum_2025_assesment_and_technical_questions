//This is the one of the OA round question asked in 2025

-> 
/**
4
1 10
2 5
4 8
1 15

 2 0 0 3
1 2 2 0

input is
first line is the number of ranges you wanna give. here in the example we have taken 4. so next lines we will be writing 4 ranges

1st line of output is "How many other ranges can the current range contain" in sequence.
by contain it means for example if there are two ranges (a,b) and (c,d) then first range contains second range would happen only if a<=c and d<=b.

here in the example consider the first range (1,10) , it can contain (2,5) and (4,8) but not (1,15) so total it can contain 2 ranges out of rest so for the first range the value will be 2.
similarly for the other ranges.

2 0 0 3 means

that the first range (1,10) can contain 2 other ranges.
 the second (2,5) and third (4,8) range cant contain any other range that's why its 0
and the last range (1,15) can contain all 3.
[12-10-2024 11:17 AM] Shashank Yadav 3rd Yera: 2nd line of ouput is "in many other ranges is the current range Contained" in sequence

by Contained it mean,

for example the first range (1,10) is contained by the range(1,15) only so it is contained by 1 range
the next range (2,5) is contained by the range(1,10) and range (1,15) so total 2 ranges 
similarly for the third range (4,8)
and for the last range (1,15) it is not contained by any so 0

//This is the technical round question :

/**
See this are the interview questions they asked in technical round :
1) return an array of digits present in a string,that string being the input
2)sum the squares of each digit in a number and repeat this process until we get the number '1',whic return True if it falls into a loop return false 
3)given a list of numbers print the next permutation 
i,e if [2,5,3,7,9,8,1] the output should be [2,5,3,8,1,7,9]
